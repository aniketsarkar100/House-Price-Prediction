# House-Price-Prediction
This project uses a machine learning approach to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, presence of amenities like air conditioning, guest rooms, and more. The dataset (Housing.csv) contains structured real estate data with both numerical and categorical variables. Categorical values were encoded using Label Encoding for model compatibility. The project utilizes Linear Regression from scikit-learn, a simple yet effective algorithm for regression tasks. We split the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate the model’s performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score. Visualizations include an Actual vs Predicted scatter plot to compare performance and a correlation heatmap to analyze feature relationships. This project serves as a great starting point for understanding regression models and preprocessing real-world data.
